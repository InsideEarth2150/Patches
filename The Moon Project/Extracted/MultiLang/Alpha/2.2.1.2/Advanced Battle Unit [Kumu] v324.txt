"Advanced Battle Unit [Kumu] v324"
2023-03-18

Pertains to file sfu324.ecoMP

Overview:
  This script can be used for both land and water units.
  The code actively manages ALL the unit's weapons and targeting individually
  It does not rely on the in-game coded "autocannon" which may introduce errors with units having multiple cannons.
  Therefore, depending on the situation it is possible that heavy unit might have all 3-4 weapons firing at different targets at the same time
  It is beta version and is provided for review and testing. Use at your own risk.

Important Note: 
  This is a complex advanced script to be used by experienced players. 
  Due to the differences in standard unit scripts and interface buttons, I recommend all selected battle units wear the same script to avoid button interface confusion.
  If button confusion happens it can be resolved by the Hot key Left ALT S 'change script' and chosing the same or different script for the group.
  Interface button confusion for units wearing this script can be reset back to default with the RESET button.

Interface has 4 main buttons/options that determine the unit's behavior

1)MovementMode:
  Chase Enemy: DEFAULT
  Hold Position:
  Hold Area: units are tethered to their home position by 8 spaces. 
      The home position is set by a STOP command or a MOVE command when a unit comes to rest 

2)RangeMode:
  Normal: DEFAULT, unit moves to target, similar to the in-game 'Battle Unit' and "Advanced Battle Unit' scripts 
  Max Range: a Unit currently not in range will move into a position so that maximum range cannon(s) are in range
  Note: if a target is already in range the unit will NOT move farther away to get to Max Range  
  All Range: a Unit currently not in range will move into a position so that all cannons are in range

3)TargetingMode:
  Nearest: DEFAULT
  Weakest: determined by HP
  Sickest: determined by %loss of HP
  Strongest: determined by HP
  HYBRID N/S: targeting mixture of 80% Nearest and 20% Weakest
  Note NEW Feature: Units not on 'Nearest' will only search for targets within the cannon's range, this prevents the unit from moving out of position to get in range for a distant target
  
4)AttackBehavior:
  Attack-Move: DEFAULT, game standard behavior, all selected units will move to attempt shot on target
  Attack-Hold: Only those units in range will shoot at the target, those units not in range will not move
                and will search for alternative targets (recommended setting for focused fire technique as well as artillary units)

Other button options:
==========	
 Kill Ruins: DEFAULT OFF;  Kill Ruins ON will include ruins in the targeting array but not exclusively
 Kill Walls: DEFAULT OFF;  Kill Walls ON will include walls in the targeting array but not exclusively
 
==========
 Note NEW targetting features:
 Buildings: DEFAULT ON,
 Buildings: OFF  unit will not target buildings unless given ATTACK order(+) cursor 
 Units: DEFAULT ON
 Units: OFF   unit will not target units unless given ATTACK order(+) cursor
 
==========
 Special Lights: not a toggle, click to have lights OFF at rest or <10 spaces of destination, lights ON if move >=20 spaces
   The Lights toggle button in the first column remains intact but will show Lights SPCL is selected
 
==========
EarthQ Button: button is only visible if the unit has an earthquake generator
  EarthQ OFF: DEFAULT
  EarthQ ON: The earthquake generators continuously fire (no longer have to click the ground)
  Note: the EarthQ ON setting will override the Buildings OFF setting
  
========== 			
FRONTLINE formation:
  Purpose: to align a group of units along an offensive/defensive line and have them face all in one direction
  
  How to give the order:
  Select a group of units, hit FRONTLINE button and draw the line on the ground with cursor to have the units move and line up in HOLDPOSITION
  Note NEW feature; Units given this command will move to the Frontline much faster than previous version before they start assembling in line (Brit's request)
  Units will move one step at a time when they are within 5 squares of the line
  Units that are in FRONTLINE mode maybe advanced forward by drawing a new line or;
  If the user desires the selected frontline group to move only one square forward hit the FRONTLINE button and double click the ground (anywhere)
  
==========		
STOP button: Hidden, use the hotkey "S"
  Selected units will stop and clear all their targets and acquire new targets. No interface settings are changed.
  
==========
RESET Button: Hover over to view the current version of the script. Click to clear all current targets and reset all values/buttons to default settings.
